    <img src="../img/porkchops.jpg">
    <p>This recipe is for Pork chops with an apple cider glaze on top.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6(6 ounce) boneless center-cut pork chops</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups apple cider</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced rosemary</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Season pork chop with salt and black pepper.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
            <p align="justify">Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
                Cook pork chops in the hot oil mixture until browned on both
                sides and pork is slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes
                per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
                should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pan
                from the heat; transfer pork chops to a plate.    
            </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Stir garlic into the pan and place over medium-high heat; cook
               and stir for 30 seconds. Pour in vinegar and scrape up any browned
               bits from the bottom of the pan. Add apple cider and Dijon mustard,
               bring mixture to a boil, and cook until sauce is reduced and thick,
               3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rosemary and red pepper flakes; season with
               salt and black pepper to taste. 
            </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Return pork chops to the pan to warm slightly, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</p>
    </ol>
